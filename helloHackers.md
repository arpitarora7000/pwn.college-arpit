# Intro to Commands

In this challenge I was asked to open terminal in the pwn.college dojo(desktop) and invoke the 'hello' command

## My solve

**Flag:**'pwn.college{wYZM3R3ib1BOQX6naBmJhFyD_x2.QX3YjM1wCOwIzNzEzW}'


Simply, we execute the hello command in the terminal and it gives us the flag, following is an image of it.

## What I Learned

I learnt how to open terminal in that desktop and simply run a command, one of the first building blocks to move ahead.

# Introduction to Arguments

## What I Learned
I learnt about the echo command in the theory about arguments above the challenge which simply said that it is analogous to a print statement which returns back what ever one puts into it as argument, and also how cammands can take up multiple arguments, and experienced how to run a command with an argument.
## References
None.
# Command History


In this challenge the flag was injected in the history, we were asked to roll through the history after opening the terminal by using arrows.
## My solve
**Flag:**'pwn.college{olRzDC_jljlSh4ksh0kobLUwfcF.0lNzEzNxwCOwIzNzEzW}'
Just rolling through the history in the terminal which they injected our flag in, and finding our flag was the task, following is an image for it.

## What I Learned
I learned a very useful thing about the terminal, that how can one easily check what commands they've used in past which makes everything accesible.
