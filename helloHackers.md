# Intro to Commands

In this challenge I was asked to open terminal in the pwn.college dojo(desktop) and invoke the 'hello' command

## My solve

**Flag:**'pwn.college{wYZM3R3ib1BOQX6naBmJhFyD_x2.QX3YjM1wCOwIzNzEzW}'


Simply, we execute the hello command in the terminal and it gives us the flag, following is an image of it.
