# cat: not the pet but the command!

After thoroughly reading the statement attached to the problem I got out the following key points
### Key points
- cat is most often used for reading out files.
- cat can concatenate multiple files if given multiple arguments.
- if no arguments are given to cat, it'll read from the terminal
## My solve 
**Flag :** 'pwn.college{0Mxrr8yMySefW7flgj3opNV5NWA.QXxcTN0wCOwIzNzEzW}'
I simply had to give **flag**as an argument to the **cat** command and it gave out the flag.

## What I Learned
