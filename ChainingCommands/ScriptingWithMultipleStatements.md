# Scripting with multiple conditions
1. One can also script using multiple conditions, by the `elif` statement.

elif does need the `then` after each elif.

3. For this challenge --> For this challenge, write a script at /home/hacker/solve.sh that:

 - Takes one argument
 - If the argument is "hack", output "the planet"
 - If the argument is "pwn", output "college"
 - If the argument is "learn", output "linux"
 - For any other input, output "unknown"

Once your script works correctly, run /challenge/run to get your flag!

> NOTE: As you're creating your script, make sure to follow the spacing closely in the examples. Unlike many other languages, bash requires the [ and the ] to be separated from other characters by spaces, otherwise it cannot parse the condition.

## My solve
**Flag :** `pwn.college{c7x3N6TXmWxwXHRcndZnyuM-dEj.0FOzMDOxwCOwIzNzEzW}`

Wrote the if clause then 2 elif clauses, and then the else, then ran `/challenge/run`, to get the flag.

## What I Learned
- Learned about `elif`, used for multiple conditions before `else`.
