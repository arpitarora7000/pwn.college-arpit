# Handling Failure
### Key points
1. Opposite to `&&` is the `||`, this challenge is about learning about it.
2. The || operator allows you to run a second command only if the first command fails (exits with a non-zero code). This is called the "OR" operator because either the first command succeeds OR the second command will run.

3. The || operator is super useful for providing fallback commands or error handling!
4. Chaining /challenge/first-failure and /challenge/second with `||`.

## My solve
**Flag :** `pwn.college{M3Dktctw242LJVUoX97f8UA_Yal.01M0MDOxwCOwIzNzEzW}`

Just chained the commands to get the flag.

## What I Learned
- Learned about the `||` operator used to chain is the exact opposite of the `&&` which lets only one of the commands work which are chained
