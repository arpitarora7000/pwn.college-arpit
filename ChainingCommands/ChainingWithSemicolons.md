# Chaining With Semicolons
### Key Points
1. The easiest way to chain commands is ;. In most contexts, ; separates commands in a similar way to how Enter separates lines. So, this:

2. When we hit enter after typing in a command, it prompts again expecting another command, using `;` is analogous to that, just without the prompt and with you entering both commands before anything is executed.
3. Here, I gotta chain /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag :** `pwn.college{k7dkbOgtS9RtcwNGZ8HcXDCyPMd.QX1UDO0wCOwIzNzEzW}`

Just ran `/challenge/pwn; /challenge/college` to get the flag.

## What I Learned
- Learned about `;` how it is used for chaining commands, and is analogous to writing commands one after the other.
