# Learning from Documentation
### Key points
1. Correct usage of programs depends on proper specification of arguments to them, like it was the case for **ls** command to show hidden files using _-a_.
2. Program for this challenge is **/challenge/challenge**, we have to invoke it properly, in order for it to give out the flag.
3. Following is the given documentation:
