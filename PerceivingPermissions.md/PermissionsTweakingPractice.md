## My solve
**Flag :** `pwn.college{kr0BOaaSsZhCKVEhy9Bep7QIi2q.QXwEjN0wCOwIzNzEzW}`

Starting with /challenge/run, I ran all commands in line to get access to /flag, then used chmod to make it readble for the user, then found the flag.

## What I Learned
- Just wrote a lot of commands using `chmod`, to get access to /flag, which made the concepts very clearer.
