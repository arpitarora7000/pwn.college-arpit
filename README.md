# Linux Luminarium
_Linux Luminarium_ is a dojo in _pwn.college_, which comprises of 16 modules and 127 challenges in total.

This module teaches me to use the Linux command line interface, and incept some core Linux concepts along the way, learning from this doesn't require any pre-requisites.

This was assigned to me for my taskphase at the cybersecurity and ethical hacking student project **cryptonite**.

All the files in this repository comprise of write-ups for each challenge of each module that I solve in the Linux Luminarium.

Files within the repository are named after the particular module it is meant for.
